This is the first week of my java coding journey where I write basic programs in java to familiarize myself to the language.
<h3>Day to Day Progress</h3>
In the first day, I created a program that processes the obtained and full marks of various subjects to determine the percentage obtained and whether the student had passed or failed.
The program does not have any user input.

[Day 1](src/day1)

On the second day, the program from Day 1 was modified to allow uder input and allowed the uder to determine the number of subjects that can be inout and calculated.

[Day 2](src/day2)

On the third day, a quiz is created in Java that displays the questions and options and allows users to input their answers that are then computed and their total scores are displayed. The program follows a repeatative procedural paradigm which will be modidied to object oriented in the upcoming days.

[Day 3](src/day3)

On the fourth day, the quiz on the third day was modified with arrays and loops for a more concise chunk of code. Tyhe program now uses various arrays and multiple loops to iterate through the questions and options and determines the answers,

[Day 4](src/day4)

On the fifth day, hashmap was used to modify the quiz. With that the questions can now be randomized. All the optentional user input errors and exceptions were also handled.

[Day 5](src/day5)

On the sixth day, a program was created along with a sample text file that is able to read the files and count the number of lines and characters within the  files and display it. File and Scanner class were used along with the necessary exception handling.

[Day 6](src/day6)
