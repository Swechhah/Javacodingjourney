# Javacodingjourney
This is the repository documenting my journey into learning back-end development with java throughout the weeks. The repository contains my progress from basic java program to a complete software developed using th language and its frameworks. The programs are arranged on a weekly basis and are direct ly accesibe by the links below.

In the second week, the relational database was created along with the tables and data was inserted to practice the different queries to display various data in different formats. 

The details of the first day of the second week of project is given here.

[Day 1](SQLqueriesday1)

Thes second day consisted of determining the relationships between tables and identifying the primary and foreign keys within the tables present.

[Day 2](SQLqueriesday2)

The third day consisted of creating an entity relationship digram as well as creating the database and tables for the system.

[Day 3](SQLqueriesday3)

The fourth day consisted of adding manual values in the databse system to be able to perform various queries in the database.
Similarly a dump file was created so that the databse can be easily recreated in other domains 

[Day 4](SQLqueriesday4)

[Dump File](portfolio_dump_file.sql)

The fifth day consisted of inserting various kinds of simple queries among the manually entered data in the database. 
The queries were executed using a script file that was directly executed into the comand line.

[Day 5](SQLqueriesday5)

[Script File](MySQLQueryScript.sql)

The sixth day consisted of connecting to the database using a Java program. For this, the database driver was connected to intellij code editor after which the code was executed. The external mysql-8.3.0 connector was connected and the code was executed.

[Day 6](SQLDatabaseConnection.java)

The seventh day consisted of extracting and displaying the data in the database that has been uploaded manually.

[Day 7](DataRetrieval.java)
