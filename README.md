# Javacodingjourney
This is the repository documenting my journey into learning back-end development with java throughout the weeks. The repository contains my progress from basic java program to a complete software developed using th language and its frameworks. The programs are arranged on a weekly basis and are direct ly accesibe by the links below.

In the second week, the relational database was created along with the tables and data was inserted to practice the different queries to display various data in different formats. 

The details of the first day of the second week of project is given here.
