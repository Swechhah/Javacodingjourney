On the third day of the database design, the database and its subsequent tables were created in the database management system. 
For this, the final entity relationship diagram was created which can be accessed within the branch.
Then the mysql was accessed by using the command 'mysql -u username -p'
Then, the database was created with the CREATE DATABASE portfolio_management_system query
After this, the USE portfolio_management_system query was input
then the tables were created as follows:

 CREATE TABLE AboutInfo(
    InfoID INT,
    FullName VARCHAR(255),
    Title VARCHAR(255),
    Description VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY(InfoID));

CREATE TABLE Services (
    ServiceID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ServiceName VARCHAR(100),
    Description TEXT,
    InfoID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (ServiceID),
    FOREIGN KEY (InfoID) REFERENCES AboutInfo(InfoID)
);

CREATE TABLE Skills (
    SkillID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    SkillName VARCHAR(100),
    Description TEXT,
    InfoID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (SkillID),
    FOREIGN KEY (InfoID) REFERENCES AboutInfo(InfoID)
);

CREATE TABLE Projects (
    ProjectID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ProjectName VARCHAR(100),
    Description TEXT,
    StartDate DATE,
    CompletionDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (ProjectID)
);

CREATE TABLE ContactInfo (
    ContactID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY (ContactID)
);
