On the fifth day, a few basic queries were executed in the database based on the manually entered data within the system. 
The queries were executed by using a script file to store the queries which has been uploaded alongside.

The five basic queries done are as follows:

1. Query to display data on projects whose completion date is after a certain date.
SELECT * FROM Projects WHERE CompletionDate > '2023-06-01';

2. Query to count all the projects starting from a particular start date

SELECT StartDate, COUNT(*) AS NumProjects
FROM Projects
GROUP BY StartDate;

3. Query to display first five data retrieved
SELECT * FROM Skills LIMIT 5;

4. Query to display the projects that have started later than the average start date
SELECT * FROM Projects WHERE StartDate > (SELECT AVG(StartDate) FROM Projects);

5. Query to join two tables to display the interconnected data and information
SELECT Projects.*, Skills.SkillName, Skills.Description
FROM Projects
LEFT JOIN Skills ON Projects.ProjectID = Skills.InfoID;
